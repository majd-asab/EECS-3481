# Applied cryptogophy course

The algorithem files for different ciphers the are classes I developed as we progressed through the applied cryptology course.

## Installation

* Install java.
* You might as well install eclipse IDE.

## Usage

I've tried to stick to functions and parameters passing style through the course. 
In most cases you just have to make you Cipher text file, and assign the path of the file to the Crypto.FileToBytes method which will read the text files into bytes and the the classes should take care of the rest.

3. Commit your changes: `git commit -am 'Add some feature'`
4. Push to the branch: `git push origin my-new-feature`
5. Submit a pull request :D

## History

The projects start from symmetric monoalphabetic ciphers all the way to modern day RSA public and private ciphers
