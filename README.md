# Applied cryptogophy course

The algorithem files for different ciphers I developed and worked on as we progressed through the applied cryptology course.

## Installation

* Install java.
* Install eclipse IDE.

## Usage

I've tried to stick to methods and parameters passing style through the course. 
In most cases(symmetric ciphers) you just have to make your cipher text file, and assign the path of the file to the Crypto.FileToBytes method which will read the text files into bytes and the class methods should take care of the rest.

## Contributing

1. Fork it!
2. Create your feature branch: `git checkout -b my-new-feature`
3. Commit your changes: `git commit -am 'Add some feature'`
4. Push to the branch: `git push origin my-new-feature`
5. Submit a pull request :D

## History

The projects start from symmetric monoalphabetic ciphers all the way to modern day RSA public and private ciphers
